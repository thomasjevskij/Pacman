Week 17 (R4):
	Change of render batch to sprite batch

Week 18 (R5):
	Removal of Boost++													Too much effort learning for too little gain
	Removal of BSP tree													We have yet to locate the need for optimization
	Removal of GameObject base class									No use of polymorphism
	Both IngameScreen and Scene implements GameEventSubscriber			Both need the information (reactions in both the 3D scene and in the HUD)
	Sprite batch removed												Not sure if we need that optimization yet
	Camera controller using strategy pattern							Different cameras have different behaviors
	Removed level variable from GameplayHandler							LevelHandler already handles it
	Simplified LevelHandler interface									It could do too much
	Adding r2tk library													Primitives, Singletons, exceptions
	Removal of deferred rendering										Time
